#Game Features

Player Control:
The player controls a movable orange box located at the bottom of the game screen.
Movement is achieved using the left (←) and right (→) arrow keys on the keyboard.
The player can move horizontally within the boundaries of the game area.
Falling Objects:
Black circular objects are generated at random positions at the top of the screen and fall downward at a constant speed.
These objects represent obstacles that the player must avoid.
Collision Detection:
If the player's character comes into contact with any falling object, the game ends immediately.
A collision is detected when a falling object overlaps with the player's position.
Scoring System:
The player earns 1 point for every falling object that successfully passes the player without causing a collision.
The score is displayed in real-time at the top-left corner of the screen.
Game Over:
When the player is hit by a falling object, a pop-up alert displays the final score.
The game automatically reloads after the alert, allowing the player to restart and try again.
